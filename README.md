# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Identification of marketing groups and analysis of a shopping customer segmentation

# About the project
Understanding the target customers for a marketing team and dividing the mall target market into approachable groups. Thus creating subsets of a market based on demographics behavioral criteria to better understand the target for marketing activities. This will be answered by identifying the best possible cluster using KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate and multivariate clusters. Once these clusters are identified, summary statistics will be perform on these to identify the best marketing group at the mall. The approach was to perform exploratory data analysis, use KMeans Clustering Algorith to create segements, use summary statistics on clusters, and visualize the data.

The final analysis was that the main target group was cluster 4 because they had a high spending score and high income. 54% of cluster 4 shoppers were women therefore the marketing team should create a campaign to attract these customers by targeting popular items in this particular cluster. Cluster 0 had a low spending score and low income therefore the marketing team should present an opportunity to market sales events on popular item to these customers. They would have to be more of a strategic clustering for items for cluster 2, cluster 4, and cluster 1 by learning more about each customer ID and spending items to then create a robust marketing campaign.
